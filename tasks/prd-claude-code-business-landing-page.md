- No affiliate program or referral system
- No course platform/LMS integration (just landing page)
- No blog or content marketing sections
- No A/B testing framework (can be added post-launch)
- No video testimonials (text-based social proof only in v1)

## Design Considerations

- **Visual Style:** Professional, modern, clean - not too corporate, not too casual
- **Color Scheme:** Use colors that convey trust and professionalism (blues, greens) with high-contrast CTAs (orange, green, or red)
- **Typography:** Large, readable fonts - assume audience is 35-55 years old
- **Layout:** Single column with clear visual hierarchy and ample whitespace
- **Images:** Use real screenshots of Claude Code in action, not stock photos
- **CTAs:** High contrast, large buttons with clear action words ("Get Instant Access", "Buy Now", "Start Learning")
- **Mobile-First:** Design mobile experience first, then scale up to desktop

## Technical Considerations

- **Framework:** Use modern web framework (Next.js, React, or similar) for fast performance
- **Hosting:** Static hosting (Vercel, Netlify) for speed and reliability
- **Payment:** Integrate Stripe or similar for secure payment processing
- **Analytics:** Google Analytics or similar for conversion tracking
- **SEO:** Include proper meta tags, Open Graph tags for social sharing
- **Performance:** Image optimization, code splitting, lazy loading
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (alt text, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)

## Success Metrics

- **Primary:** Conversion rate of visitors to purchases (target: 2-5% for cold traffic, 10-20% for warm traffic)
- **Secondary:** Average time on page (target: 3+ minutes indicates engagement)
- **Tertiary:** Scroll depth (target: 60%+ reach final CTA)
- **Revenue:** Average order value and total revenue from launch
- **Engagement:** CTA click-through rate (target: 15-25% of visitors click at least one CTA)
